# preferential_voting_Blockhain

In a survey we found that sometimes elected candidates have a minor percentage of total votes which is sometimes not appreciated by everyone. So to have a majority of votes and have a fair election, Preferential Voting is a good solution. In this voting the voters can give their preferences of their choice and according to the preferences we can select the winner of the election. This makes elections much more fair than the traditional method.
